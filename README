This is a compiler for a subset of Pascal. It was written by Maan Rachid
at  Suffolk University (2002).  

to use it lets assume you have a pascal code in file test.pas   


   compiler <test.pas  >test.res


test.res need to be interpreted to run :


   interpret test.res 


to see the code generation of the code 


   disassemble test.res
