This is a compiler for a subset of Pascal. It was mostly written by Maan Rachid
at  Suffolk University (2002).  

To use it, let us assume you have a pascal code in a file test.pas   


   compiler <test.pas  >test.res


test.res needs to be interpreted in order to run the code:


   interpret test.res 


To see the code generation of the code 


   disassemble test.res  


demo folder has several pascal files to test.

Note: bison, flex, flex-devel should be installed (using yum or apt-get)
